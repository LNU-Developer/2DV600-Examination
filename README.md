## Handin
- My whole handin of this examination has been done in a repo style way.
- In order to find my solutions, please navigate to the src folder and each exercise can be found in a folder structure TaskX where x corresponds to the exercise number.
- For the theoretical questions e.g. exercise 5 or duplicate time complexity I have either created a md file or commented directly in the code to motivate.
